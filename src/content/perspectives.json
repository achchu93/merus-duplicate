Like if you change the design, what happens to construction and vice versa. And so it was a really cool experience. I got to, I think, manage up to five projects simultaneously.

And so I had, you know, 30 people and I was like, okay, if I do A then B, maybe I do B then A. Then I remember sitting there thinking... I clearly remember this. It was like 6:00 AM, sun's rising. It's really cold, freezing. And I'm like, man, I gotta be like stupid. I can't figure this thing out. You know? And then yeah, years later I started working on the PhD and AI and algorithms and all this. And I was like, actually it turns out it's not an easy problem. It's a relatively complex little problem. And so that was, I started researching how to develop algorithms that will solve that sequencing question. And then the other thing that I started developing was algorithms. I got interested in space usage and construction sites. And so it's again, this kind of rare kind of insight, which is that you suddenly see something in a different way. And so I was on a project in Amsterdam, looking for a topic. Every PhD student needs a topic. That's kind of the big, you know, big stress for the first couple of years. And so there, the project was I think, six weeks late, 50,000 euros a day in damages. And so I get up and I look out of the window. And the guy is going, like, I can't work any faster. I can't work any faster. And I look outside and there's six people in a hundred thousand square feet of space. And it hit me like a lead brick. Every project I've ever seen has been empty. And literally, drive down the road, look at any construction project. It's never crawling with people. There might be, you know, a pocket of work. And so I was like, holy cow, construction sites are empty. So I started measuring it, and figured out that 3% of construction space is used for construction. So 97% is free. So it was like, great, other fields, if you're looking at manufacturing, have asset utilization of 60%, 70%, 50%, that's kind of regular. Three is really low. So I was like, okay, all I’ve got to do is increase space usage, right? Show that it reduces construction duration, if I'm scheduling more things concurrently. I got my PhD."

And so then the automatic knee jerk reaction is, oh, but wait a minute, getting a computer to simulate construction, that's gotta be really complicated. Like how would you put all those rules in there? And that's the kicker, that's the thing that we did that hasn't been done before, we've given you a \"translator\". A way that you can translate these complex construction constraints, scalably. And so you don't sit there and have to input 5,500 tasks. You input 15 recipes and those recipes get multiplied out and connected. And there's this whole system that we developed. So it's these two pieces of the puzzle, this translator that allows you to get what's in your head and put it in the computer in a way that's scalable and checkable and validated. And then the other one was the simulation piece, which takes those rules and crunches and generates lots of simulations. But effectively the statement you made is true. Yes.

It took us about three and a half years to crack the technology. It was like, okay, we've got the combustion engine. We've connected to the car, the steering wheel, and so on. And then from there, the issue two years ago was that you need the mechanic to drive it. The car does not have windshield wipers. It doesn't really have proper seats or whatever the heck it was. And so it took us about two years to iron out the technology to a point where it's usable. It's easy, it's automated, it's scalable, it's not buggy and all those kinds of things.

It could just take a long time, long sales cycle, but especially because you're convincing them of, hey, you're doing this today in your head and I've got this thing that is better.

I've talked to people, you'd be surprised, some of these names of companies that I've mentioned, have very sophisticated R&D programs, to the point that I've looked at what they're doing.

But a second result is that we all started to notice how there was a real lack of innovation and specialization in these services. It doesn’t make much sense to use the same tool to chat with friends once a month, collaborate with coworkers on a specific document every day, or watch a panel discussion along with hundreds of other participants.

Because as we have seen, quantum objects live in Hilbert space and have lots of amplitudes associated with them.

The phenomenal growth of YouTube’s video corpus created a new pool of content that needed to be included in any search service, and it was unclear if Google would have unfettered access to index this valuable content. In all of these cases and many others, the boundary of what is within the platform was substantially extended with little concern, or even awareness, shown by regulators or the public in general."

It’s not difficult to imagine that many of these services could have been standalone companies in a world with more robust pro-competition regulatory regimes. However, it would be almost irresponsible to invest in the AWS ecosystem given Amazon’s existential need to vacuum up as much of the value around its so-called “core” cloud infrastructure.

To find the answer, it’s helpful to understand a key role of the traditional venture capitalist.

This differs from the seed round of financing when investors typically do not join the board, if one exists at all.

A commanding personality, change-the-world attitude, sexy hardware designs and even a standard wardrobe of black turtlenecks. It was a compelling story that caused stakeholders to believe they were in the presence of greatness. Lastly, it’s of course much easier to rely on the opinions of others, particularly if they are well-regarded, rather than doing the heavy lifting of due diligence yourself.

As a result, one should not follow the flavor of the week or sacrifice a vision because someone else pretends to know better. We find this correlates very well to investing and company building.
